[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/codemirror-promql.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/codemirror-promql)

## Overview
This project provides a mode for [CodeMirror Next](https://codemirror.net/6) that handles syntax highlighting, linting and autocompletion for the PromQL ([Prometheus Query Language](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)).

> Initially this code was in a private repository. It has been transferred to the `prometheus-community` organization (Thanks to [Julius Volz](https://github.com/juliusv) who helped us with that).
During the transfer, the repository and the package changed its name from `codemirror-mode-promql` to the current one: `codemirror-promql`.

### Installation
This mode is available as an npm package:

```bash
npm install codemirror-promql
```

**Note:** You will have to manually install [CodeMirror Next](https://codemirror.net/6), as it is a peer dependency to this package.

### Playground
You can try out the latest release version of this mode on:

https://prometheus-community.github.io/codemirror-promql/

Here is a short preview of it looks like currently:

### RoadMap
A roadmap is available in the issue [#5](https://github.com/prometheus-community/codemirror-promql/issues/5).

## Usage

As the setup of the PromQL language can a bit tricky in CMN, this lib provides a class `PromQLExtension` 
which is here to help you to configure the different extensions we aim to provide.

### Default setup
If you want to enjoy about the different features provided without taking too much time to understand how to configure them,
then the easiest way is this one:

```typescript
import { PromQLExtension } from 'codemirror-promql';
import { basicSetup, EditorState, EditorView } from '@codemirror/next/basic-setup';

const promQL = new PromQLExtension()
new EditorView({
  state: EditorState.create({
    extensions: [basicSetup, promQL.asExtension()],
  }),
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion
  // tslint:disable-next-line:no-non-null-assertion
  parent: document.getElementById('editor')!,
});
```

Using the default setup will activate:
* syntax highlighting
* an offline autocompletion that will suggest PromQL keywords such as functions / aggregations, depending on the context.
* an offline linter that will display PromQL syntax errors (which is closer to what Prometheus returns)

### Deactivate autocompletion - linter
In case you would like to deactivate the linter and/or the autocompletion it's simple as that:

```typescript
const promQL = new PromQLExtension().activateLinter(false).activateCompletion(false) // here the linter and the autocomplete are deactivated
```

### maxMetricsMetadata

maxMetricsMetadata is the maximum limit of the number of metrics in Prometheus. Under this limit, it allows the completion to get the metadata of the metrics.

By default, the limit is 10 000 metrics. 

Use it cautiously. A high value of this limit can cause a crash of your browser due to too many data fetched.

```typescript
const promQL = new PromQLExtension().setComplete({maxMetricsMetadata: 10000})
```

### enricher

enricher is a function that will allow user to enrich the current completion by adding a custom one. It takes two parameters:

* `trigger` should be used to decide whenever you would like to trigger your custom completion.
  It's better to not trigger the same completion for multiple different ContextKind.
  For example, the autocompletion of the metricName / the function / the aggregation happens at the same time.
  So if you want to trigger your custom completion for metricName / function / aggregation, you should just choose to trigger it for the function for example.
  Otherwise, you will end up to have the same completion result multiple time.

* `result` is the current result of the completion. Usually you don't want to override it but instead to concat your own completion with this one.

```typescript
import { Completion } from '@codemirror/next/autocomplete';
import { ContextKind } from 'codemirror-promql';

function myCustomEnricher(trigger: ContextKind, result: Completion[]): Completion[] | Promise<Completion[]> {
  switch (trigger) {
      case ContextKind.Aggregation:
        // custom completion
        // ...
        // return result.concat( myCustomCompletionArray )
      default:
        return result;
    }
}
const promQL = new PromQLExtension().setComplete({enricher: myCustomEnricher})
```

### Connect the autocompletion extension to a remote Prometheus server
Connecting the autocompletion extension to a remote Prometheus server will provide autocompletion of metric names, label names, and label values.

#### Use the default Prometheus client

##### Prometheus URL
If you want to use the default Prometheus client provided by this lib, you have to provide the url used to contact the Prometheus server.

```typescript
const promQL = new PromQLExtension().setComplete({remote: {url: 'https://prometheus.land'}})
```

##### Override FetchFn
In case your Prometheus server is protected and requires a special HTTP client, you can override the function `fetchFn` that is used to perform any required HTTP request.

```typescript
const promQL = new PromQLExtension().setComplete({remote: {fetchFn: myHTTPClient}})
```

##### Error Handling
You can set up your own error handler to catch any HTTP error that can occur when the PrometheusClient is contacting Prometheus.

```typescript
const promQL = new PromQLExtension().setComplete({remote: {httpErrorHandler: (error:any) => console.error(error)}})
```

#### Override the default Prometheus client
In case you are not satisfied by our default Prometheus client, you can still provide your own. 
It has to implement the interface [PrometheusClient](https://github.com/prometheus-community/codemirror-promql/blob/master/src/lang-promql/client/prometheus.ts#L111-L117).

```typescript
const promQL = new PromQLExtension().setComplete({remote: {prometheusClient: MyPrometheusClient}})
```

### Example

* The development [app](./src/app) can give you an example of how to use it with no TS Framework.
* [How to use it in an angular project](./examples/angular-promql/README.md)

## Contributions
Any contribution or suggestion would be really appreciated. Feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/prometheus-community/codemirror-promql/issues) or [send a pull request](https://github.com/prometheus-community/codemirror-promql/pulls).

## Development
In case you want to contribute and change the code by yourself, run the following commands:

To install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To start the web server:

```
npm start
```

This should create a tab in your browser with the development app that contains CodeMirror Next with the PromQL plugin.

### Autocompletion

The autocompletion feature has 2 different modes, each requiring a different setup:

 * **prometheus**: This mode requires starting a Prometheus server listening on port 9090.
 * **offline**: This mode doesn't require anything.

### Linter

The linter feature has only an offline mode that doesn't require any particular setup.

### Deploy to Github Pages
* `npm install -g angular-cli-ghpages`
* Change into the `examples/angular-promql` directory.
* `ng build --prod --base-href "https://prometheus-community.github.io/codemirror-promql/"`
* `ngh -d dist/angular-promql`
